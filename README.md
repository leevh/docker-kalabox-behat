Docker image for running Behat tests (in Kalabox).
============

This image is based on [Drush Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/drush/drush/) with PHP5 and is used by [kalabox-behat plugin](https://github.com/leevh/kalabox-behat) for now, but may be either deprecated or tested and used as a generic behat container. 

This image installs [Drupal extension](https://packagist.org/packages/drupal/drupal-extension) on top of the standard php5 drush image.
